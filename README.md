**RocketFlare** is a lightweight and powerful tool designed to scan websites for vulnerabilities in Cloudflareâ€™s Rocket Loader implementation. This vulnerability involves insecure HTML injection, which can pose a significant security risk if not addressed. The tool checks for the presence of this issue, allowing for proactive mitigation.

## **Features**

- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies insecure Rocket Loader HTML injection vulnerabilities.
- **Single URL and Bulk Scanning**: Supports both single URL scans and bulk scans from a file.
- **Auto-Completion for File Paths**: Simplifies file path selection for efficient workflow.
- **Detailed Output**: Provides clear and color-coded feedback about vulnerable URLs.
- **Save Results**: Option to save vulnerable URLs to a file for future reference.

## **Prerequisites**

- **Bash Shell** (Linux, macOS, or WSL for Windows)
- **Curl** (for making HTTP requests)
- **Optional**: Text editor for editing URL files.

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
